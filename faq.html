        <p class="ques">1. What types of photography do you do?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          Some photographers do a little of everything. Others specialize in one
          type of photography or another. The first thing that people are going
          to want to know is what kind of services you offer. If they’re looking
          for a family photographer or someone to do their son’s senior
          portraits, for example, they wouldn’t want to work with a wedding
          photographer.

        <p class="ques">2. Are deposits refundable?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          If you’re like most professional photographers, you take a deposit
          with each booking to provide a little security and peace of mind. This
          holds people accountable and shows them the value of your time. What
          happens, though, when there’s an emergency or something comes up that
          requires rescheduling or cancellation? Do you keep deposits? Perhaps
          you only keep part of them. People are going to want to know,
          regardless.

        <p class="ques">3. When will we get our finished prints?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          Here’s another common question that we see. People are impatient and
          they want their finished product as soon as possible. They often don’t
          understand the time-consuming process of editing and proofing photos
          before they can be delivered to the client. Make sure that you not
          only explain how long clients should expect to wait, but why the wait
          takes that much time so that they are aware of what they are paying
          for—your professional expertise
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sec4">
        <p class="ques">4. Do you include digital images?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          Today, people often want digital copies of photos along with or even
          instead of physical photos. Moreover, some photographers only work
          with certain mediums in the same regard, for one reason or another.
          Therefore, most people will ask if digital images are available if
          they want them. However, they may not always be an option. Be sure to
          advise as to whether you offer digital images with prints, instead of
          them, or in any other capacity. If you do not provide digital image
          copies for any reason, explain that here so that clients understand
          your reasoning.

      <div class="sec5">
        <p class="ques">5. What’s your cancellation/rescheduling policy?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          No one likes a cancellation, but sometimes things happen. Therefore,
          you’ll need to make sure that you have contingency plans in place and
          that you can share them with your clients and potential clients. Be
          clear about what is expected, how much notice is required, and what
          the terms are for last-minute emergencies and other potential hiccups.
          If you allow rescheduling or accept last-minute cancellations with a
          fee, this is the place to spell that out. Make it clear what you
          require and expect from people so that there is no confusion. As a
          bonus, invite them to contact you to discuss their scheduling issues
          before making any decisions. It may not create any better solutions,
          but it shows your willingness to work with them.

      <div class="sec6">
        <p class="ques">6. Do I get the copyright/ownership of my photos?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          Ownership is a big topic in the world of photography. You’ll want to
          make sure that you explain the process of delivering images, including
          who retains ownership, whether people have the right to copy or make
          additional prints, and so forth. If you keep the raw image files and
          don’t provide them, explain why. Make sure that you’re completely
          transparent about what your clients get when they work with you so
          that they can make an educated decision. You don’t necessarily have to
          give up the copyright; a proper explanation is sometimes all that
          people need.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sec7">
        <p class="ques">7. How long will our session take?</p>
        <p class="ans">
          People are always worried about time. They want to know you’re not
          going to take too much of it, but also that they’ll get every second
          that they pay for. It’s a balancing act, but again this is about
          providing information more than actually giving a specific timeline.
          If you have a time for certain sessions, list that here. For example,
          you might offer two hours for senior portrait sessions, while wedding
          photography sessions might be booked as all-day events. Reassure
          people that they’ll get the time and attention that they deserve, but
          that you won’t overstay your welcome or drag the process out longer
          than necessary. More than an actual time, that’s what they want to
          hear.
